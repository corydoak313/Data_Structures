CS300: Data Structures- Analysis and Design

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  During this course, we worked on a number of projects that showed different methods to print out a list. 
  Each project were done by using different methods.
  
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  To begin the projects, we tested the different methods to determine which would be best to run our program.
  The three methods were using vectors, hashtables, and binary trees. These are important to know the defferences 
  because each one has its benefits and downfalls which may cause for quicker run time and memory usage. 
  
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  Being that these methods were new to me, there were definitely times of confusion. In order to get passed these 
  times I utilized the ZyBooks and did some research on youtube on how to properly use the code.
  
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  Now I have a better understanding for the uses of the different list methods and analyzing the run times. With 
  this new knowledge, I can determine the best approach to apply it to building a program to ensure the most 
  efficient approach.
  
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  In order to ensure that programs are maintainable, readable, and adaptable I can plan out pseudocode and and flowcharts 
  to help stay on track with the code. This also helps plan ahead and helps reduce wasted time or errors.
